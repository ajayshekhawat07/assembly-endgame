# Assembly Endgame: React Word Guessing Game

## Decipher the Code... One Letter at a Time!

Welcome to **Assembly Endgame**, a thrilling word guessing game built with React! In this digital puzzle, you're tasked with cracking the secret word, much like assembling the final piece of code in a complex program.  But be warned, precision is key, and attempts are limited!

Think you have the linguistic skills to succeed? Put your word-deciphering abilities to the test in **Assembly Endgame!**

## How to Play

Your mission is simple: **guess the hidden word.**  However, there's a catch:

* **Limited Attempts:** You only have **8 attempts** to guess the correct word. Make each guess count!
* **Letter by Letter:**  Type in your guess, letter by letter.
* **Feedback is Key:** After each guess, the game will provide feedback to help you narrow down the possibilities (details on feedback will be implemented in the game itself - could be letter highlighting, color coding, etc. -  *This is where you'll describe in your game how feedback is given, e.g., green for correct position, yellow for correct letter but wrong position, grey for incorrect letter.*)
* **Victory or Defeat:**
    * **Victory:** Guess the word within 8 attempts and bask in the glory of cracking the code!
    * **Defeat:** Run out of attempts and the secret word remains unsolved... better luck next time!

## Technologies Used

* **React:**  For the user interface and game logic.
