# 🎮 Assembly Endgame: React Word Guessing Game

## Decipher the Code... One Letter at a Time! 💻

Welcome to **Assembly Endgame**, a thrilling word guessing game built with React! 🎉 In this digital puzzle, you're tasked with cracking the secret word, much like assembling the final piece of code in a complex program. But be warned, precision is key 🔑, and attempts are limited! ⏳

Think you have the linguistic skills to succeed? 🤔 Put your word-deciphering abilities to the test in **Assembly Endgame!** 🚀

## How to Play

Your mission is simple: **guess the hidden word.** 🎯 However, there's a catch:

- **Limited Attempts:** You only have **8 attempts** 🚫 to guess the correct word. Make each guess count! 💯
- **Letter by Letter:** Type in your guess, letter by letter. ⌨️
- **Feedback is Key:** After each guess, the game will provide feedback to help you narrow down the possibilities (details on feedback will be implemented in the game itself - could be letter highlighting, color coding, etc. - _This is where you'll describe in your game how feedback is given, e.g., 🟢 for correct position, 🟡 for correct letter but wrong position, ⬜️ for incorrect letter._)
- **Victory or Defeat:**
  - **Victory:** Guess the word within 8 attempts and bask in the glory of cracking the code! 🏆
  - **Defeat:** Run out of attempts and the secret word remains unsolved... better luck next time! 😔
